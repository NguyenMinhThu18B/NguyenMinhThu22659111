        <span style="color: red;">Thanks to everyone who made Fiddler on the Roof Jr. such a smashing success!</span>
        After all of the hard work on rehearsals and set building and promotion, it really paid off. I have gotten so many 
        comments on your wonderful performances.<br><br>

        I've started putting up a <a href="/Bai3/home.html">slide show</a>slide show of the production. Please feel free to download the files from the Web site. 
        If you want high resolution photos on a photo CD, please contact me.<br><br>
